# Traffic distillation

## Description

Analyze the behavior of drivers on a new road to determine the optimal speed limits.

## Normal Mode

We have a 1 kilometer section of road being built and do not know what the speed limit should be. Simulate 1 kilometer of road. As mentioned above, even though this road is not circular, treat it as such in order to generate a continuous flow of traffic.


## Notes

This is incredibly similar to real work that a highway planner would do. Using these tools should highlight how randomness can be used to solve many real-world problems.

Your simulations may take quite some time to run. You should create smaller simulations and make sure they are giving you reasonable answers before scaling up.

Remember that one simulation is meaningless: you need many simulations for the law of large numbers to matter.

If you have changed a file that you're importing into IPython notebook, you may need to restart the kernel and re-run the cells to get the changes. Bceause of this, you may want to work on "rough" versions of the parts of the module inside of your notebook, and then put them in a separate module as they become more stable.
